Midterm Hints

1) Stop playing Mario Wonder...

Bitflag
- You may want to use an unsigned short instead of the char for the variable

Camera
- W and S are done for you in an example
	- change position with forward vector
- A/D: change the position with rightVec 
- R/F: change the position with upVec
- Q/E for rotation: change yaw (increase speed)

1x1 Squares
- Used as the building blocks of grid floor and maze walls
- Vertex array for position
- Index array
- color array
- 4 steps in Display function
	- transform the square
	- color the square or cube
	- draw the square
	- draw wireframe (4 verts for square)

Transform Function
- Make sure scale is sent in as an argument as a vec3 not just a float
- This will enable you to scale a wall segment with a custom scale, i.e. (4.0f, 6.0f, 1.0f)

Door
- Have a variable for the door's X position if it slides west to east for example. Then have a directional or increment variable that makes "lerp" from a start position to an end position and back.
